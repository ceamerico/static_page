## Rocketry Groups:

### Carl Sagan Rocketry Group
Member of CFD group (Computational Fluid Dynamics), Propulsion and Aerodynamics of Rockets from Federal University of Paraná. This group improve and apply computational techniques in CFD (method of characteristics, multigrid methods, finite volume methods and finite difference methods), develops its own codes and computational models using Fortran and Python as programming languages. In addition, I am one of the members responsible for structural, thermal and aerodynamic sizing of experimental rockets, mechanical drawing design, structural efforts, flying trajectory, data and performance analysis before and after flying.

Research Line: CFD, Aerodynamics and Rocket Propulsion. Member of Carl Sagan rocketry group
and CFD research group. Also, I was programming language assistant teacher in 2019. My
dissertation is related to turbulence modeling for CFD on compressible turbulent flow inside a
rocket nozzle.

### GREAVE

Co-founder of the Aerodynamics of self-propelled vehicles study group.


### 02/2019 – 12/2019 – Teacher’s Assistant of Fortran programming language: 
responsible for
Fortran programming language tutoring including: basic commands (variables and expressions,
function allocation, execution control, formats, inputs, and outputs); advanced commands
(modules, logical relation between programs and dialog boxes), and code optimization (memory
consumption analysis, running time, documentation and programming techniques).

### 03/2016 – 12/2016 - Teacher’s Assistant of Differential and Integral Calculus: 

responsible for
exercises solutions and tutoring sessions, addressing topics like multiple integrals in polar,
spherical, and rectangular coordinates; partial derivatives; ordinary and partial differential
equations; vector calculus; infinite sequences and series; line and surface integrals.
