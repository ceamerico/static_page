### 01/2021 – 06/2021 – Collaboration between my Master’s degree at UFPR and the Brazilian Institute of Aeronautics and Space: 

realized computational simulations for the gas flow inside a
rocket nozzle, obtaining temperature, pressure, velocities, dynamic and turbulent viscosity
profiles. Applying inviscid and viscous computational methods with additional equations to deal
with turbulent flow and its closure problem (RANS models in CFD++ code).

## Research groups:

### 02/2019 – Current - CFD Research Group: member of the CFD group (Computational Fluid Dynamics), Propulsion and Aerodynamics of Rockets from the Federal University of Paraná. 

This
group improves and applies computational techniques in CFD (method of characteristics,
multigrid methods, finite volume methods, and finite difference methods), develops its
computational codes and computational models using Fortran 2008 and Python as programming
languages. Also, I’m one of the members responsible for structural, thermal, and aerodynamic
sizing of experimental rockets (including but not limited to nozzles, nose cone, fins, and
diameter transitions), mechanical drawing design, parachute sizing, flying trajectory, rocket
motor static tests, data and performance analysis before and after a flight, solid propellant
mixing and manufacturing.
