## Education:

### Ms. C. Mechanical Engineering
#### Federal University of Paraná (02/2019 - 08/2021).
Member of CFD group (Computational Fluid Dynamics), Propulsion and Aerodynamics of Rockets from Federal University of Paraná. This group improve and apply computational techniques in CFD (method of characteristics, multigrid methods, finite volume methods and finite difference methods), develops its own codes and computational models using Fortran and Python as programming languages. In addition, I am one of the members responsible for structural, thermal and aerodynamic sizing of experimental rockets, mechanical drawing design, structural efforts, flying trajectory, data and performance analysis before and after flying.

Research Line: CFD, Aerodynamics and Rocket Propulsion. Member of Carl Sagan rocketry group
and CFD research group. Also, I was programming language assistant teacher in 2019. My
dissertation is related to turbulence modeling for CFD on compressible turbulent flow inside a
rocket nozzle.

### B. S. Mechanical Engineering

#### Positivo University (02/2014 - 11/2018). 

Co-founder of the Aerodynamics of self-propelled vehicles study group and co-founder of Brazilian Association of Rocketry. Also, I was a calculus assistant teacher and made three undergraduate types of research on fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, and materials engineering fields

## Complementary Formation:
### 02/2020 – 02/2021 – Aerodynamic course applied to aeronautical engineering

Fundamentals of
aerodynamics, wing and fuselage theory, wind tunnels and their experimental and mathematical
approach, drag theory, and high accuracy computational models designed for flight simulation.

### 1/2020 – Turbulent flows Minicourse

Physical, mathematical, and computational modeling of
turbulent flows.

## Work experience:

### 03/2017 – 12/2018 – Brazilian National Steel Company – Maintenance Engineering Department
Position: Intern. 

Worked at maintenance engineering department and predictive department.
Developed projects and activities ensuring reliability and availability for almost 250 equipment’s
using predictive techniques such as lubricant oil analysis, thermography analysis, and vibration
analysis. Also Responsible for planning and execute oil analysis program, contract and finances
management (via SAP and SIGMA software’s), contact with providers and laboratories, create
and arrange service orders for preventive maintenance.
Responsible for data analysis, create tendencies and KPI’s for maintenance strategy from
company previous data versus new results. Promoted, arranged and executed projects
objectifying avoid particle and water in oil contamination, cross-contamination, stabilize or grow
equipment’s life such as pumps, gearboxes, hydraulic units, generators, compressors,
proportional and directional Moog valves. Also provided systems for oil monitoring condition via
PLC using water in oil sensors and filtration media saturation, developed several filtration
systems for individual equipment’s units with unique features.
Made structural, hydraulic and thermal sizing. Realized heat exchange, and oven thermal
efficiency analysis, resulting in a proposal for thermal upgrade and oven balance. If those
changes have been implemented, it would increase production and cause an abrupt reduction in
natural gas consumption
